# Open on current desktop

Shell scripts to make applications always open on the current virtual desktop. This is intended to fix an annoying behavior with KWin where opening a window would sometimes teleport you to a different desktop without your command.

There are three cases when this happens: A program is already open on a different desktop, and either:

1. The program can only run one instance, e.g. Thunderbird.
2. The program prefers to open files in an existing window, e.g. Firefox.
3. The program raises other existing instances when opening a new file, e.g. Atom.

`open_thunderbird_on_current_desktop.sh` fixes problem 1 by moving a possible existing instance to the current desktop.

`open_firefox_on_current_desktop.sh` partially fixes problems 2 and 3 by instructing the program to open the file in a new window if there is no existing instance on the current desktop. Problem 3 is, however, not entirely solved, as the window manager will still highlight the other window and open the file in the wrong existing window. Also problem 2 might not be entirely solved due to missing file associations, e.g. the Firefox script will work for bookmarks opened from KRunner but not for links opened from Thunderbird.



## Installation

1. Ensure dependencies are installed: `awk`, `cut`, `grep`, `wmctrl`.
2. Download the script: GitHub > green top right button *Code* > *Download ZIP* > unpack > extract this folder.
3. Make the script executable: right-click on the `.sh` file > *Properties* > *Permissions* > checkbox *Is executable*



## Set-up

### 1. Programs that can only run one instance

1. Find out the window class of the program: Open a window of the program, run `wmctrl -l -x ` in a terminal, and get the window class name from the second column, e.g. `Mail.thunderbird`,
2. Insert the window class a string for the variable `win_class` in `open_thunderbird_on_current_desktop.sh`.
3. Find out the command to open the program, e.g. `thunderbird`.
4. Insert the launch command as a string for the variable `launch` in `open_thunderbird_on_current_desktop.sh`.
5. Make `open_thunderbird_on_current_desktop.sh` the way to open the desired program, e.g. by defining a custom keyboard shortcut or adding an entry in the kickoff menu or task bar (you can find instructions for this on the web).

### 2. Programs that prefer opening files in an existing window

3. Find out the window class of the program: Open a window of the program, run `wmctrl -l -x ` in a terminal, and get the window class name from the second column, e.g. `Navigator.firefox`,

4. Insert the window class a string for the variable `win_class` in `open_firefox_on_current_desktop.sh`.

5. Find out the command to open the file in a new window, e.g. `firefox -new-window` or `atom -n`.

6. Insert the launch-new command as a string for the variable `launch_new` in `open_firefox_on_current_desktop.sh`.

7. Find out the command to open the file in an existing window, e.g. `firefox -new-tab` or `atom`.

8. Insert the launch-existing command as a string for the variable `launch_old` in `open_firefox_on_current_desktop.sh`.

9. Make `open_firefox_on_current_desktop.sh` the application to open the desired file types: *System Settings* > *Applications* > *File Associations* or *Default Applications* > select relevant file types > add the path to `open_firefox_on_current_desktop.sh` and make it the top preference.
