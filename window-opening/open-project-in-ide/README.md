# Open project in IDE

Shell script and instructions to open a source code project in an IDE from the file manager.



## Installation

1. Download the script: GitHub repository > green top right button *Code* > *Download ZIP* > unpack > extract this folder.
3. Make the script executable: right-click on the `.sh` file > *Properties* > *Permissions* > checkbox *Is executable*.



## Set-up

1. Find out the command to open your IDE and insert it for `pycharm`.
2. In each directory where you want to open a source code project in an IDE from the file manager, create an empty file `directoryname.fileending`, where `directoryname` is the name of the folder where your file are and `fileending` is a custom file ending, e.g. `.pycp` for ‘PyCharm project’.
3. Make `open_pycharm_project.sh` the application to open the custom file type: *System Settings* > *Applications* > *File Associations* or *Default Applications* > select relevant file type > add the path to `open_pycharm_project.sh` and make it the top preference.



## Usage

To open the project in the IDE, click on the `directoryname.fileending` file.
