# Open on Current Desktop

Patch to make all applications, and alternatively shell scripts to make specific applications, always open on the current virtual desktop. This is intended to fix an annoying behavior with KWin where opening a window would sometimes unsolicitedly teleport you to a different desktop.

There are three cases when this happens: A program is already open on a different desktop, and either:

1. The program can only run one instance, e.g. Thunderbird or KDE System Settings.  
   This gets fixed with `open_thunderbird_on_current_desktop.sh` by moving a possible existing instance to the current desktop.

2. The program prefers to open files in an existing window, e.g. Firefox or Atom.  
   This gets fixed with `open_firefox_on_current_desktop.sh` by instructing the program to open the file in a new window if there is no existing instance on the current desktop.

3. The program raises other existing instances when opening a new file, e.g. Atom.  
   This gets fixed with [Demands Attention Only on Current Desktop](https://www.pling.com/p/1112536) by Martin Gräßlin.
   
If you are willing to build KWin from source, you can apply the patch below to fix the problem at the root and cover all cases.

If you are not comfortable with this or are not sure what building from source even is, you'll want to use the shell scripts instead.

## Patch

In [`kwin/src/activation.cpp:293`](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/master/src/activation.cpp#L293)  


```
void Workspace::activateClient(AbstractClient* c, bool force) {
    ...
    if (!c->isOnCurrentDesktop()) {
        ....
```

change

```
        VirtualDesktopManager::self()->setCurrent(c->desktops().constLast());
```

to

```
        Workspace::self()->sendClientToDesktop(c, VirtualDesktopManager::self()->current(), false);
```

Then [compile KWin from source](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development).


## Scripts

## Supported platforms

X11.

## Installation

1. Ensure dependencies are installed: `awk`, `cut`, `grep`, `wmctrl`.
2. Download the script: GitHub repository > green top right button *Code* > *Download ZIP* > unpack > extract the `open-on-current-desktop` folder.
3. Make the script executable: right-click on the `.sh` file > *Properties* > *Permissions* > checkbox *Is executable*.



## Set-up

### 1. Programs that can only run one instance

With the script `open_thunderbird_on_current_desktop.sh`:

1. Find out the window class of the program: Open an instance of the program, run `wmctrl -l -x ` in a terminal, and get the window class name from the third column, e.g. `Mail.Thunderbird` or `systemsettings5.systemsettings`.
3. Insert the window class as a string for the variable `win_class` in the script.
4. Find out the command to open the program, e.g. `thunderbird` or `systemsettings5`.
5. Insert the launch command as a string for the variable `launch` in the script.
6. Make the script the way to open the desired program, e.g. by defining a custom keyboard shortcut or adding an entry in the kickoff menu or task bar (you can find instructions for this on the web).
6. Make the script the command to be executed for any launcher you may have (task bar icon, [application menu entry](https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kmenuedit/kmenuedit/quickstart.html), [keyboard shortcut](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/jkxs8d/comment/gamggv7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), …).



### 2. Programs that prefer opening files in an existing window

With the script `open_firefox_on_current_desktop.sh`:

1. Find out the window class of the program: Open an instance of the program, run `wmctrl -l -x ` in a terminal, and get the window class name from the third column, e.g. `Navigator.firefox` or `atom.Atom`.
2. Insert the window class as a string for the variable `win_class` in the script.
3. Find out the command to open the file in a new window, e.g. `firefox -new-window` or `atom -n`.
4. Insert the launch-new command as a string for the variable `launch_new` in the script.
5. Find out the command to open the file in an existing window, e.g. `firefox -new-tab` or `atom`.
6. Insert the launch-existing command as a string for the variable `launch_old` in the script.
7. Make the script the application to open the desired file types: *System Settings* > *Applications* > *File Associations* or ... > *Default Applications* > select relevant file types > add the path to the script and make it the top preference. Note that some applications may ignore the system-wide settings and define their own program association preferences; e.g. for Thunderbird see [these instructions](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Changing_the_web_browser_invoked_by_Thunderbird).
8. Make the script the command to be executed for any launcher you may have (task bar icon, [application menu entry](https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kmenuedit/kmenuedit/quickstart.html), [keyboard shortcut](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/jkxs8d/comment/gamggv7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), …).



### 3. Programs that raise existing other windows
